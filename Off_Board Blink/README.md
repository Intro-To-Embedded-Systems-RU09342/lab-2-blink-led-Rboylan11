# Off Board Blink
The objective of this lab is to get two LEDs to blink at different frequencys on a breadboard using the microchip from the G2553 developement board. The code is essentially the same as the multiple blink lab where two pins are toggled between High and Lo with a delay cycle in between. Now the chip is placed on a breadboard and given power to the respective pins. The chip will then execute the code and toggle two pins between High and Lo, these pins are connected on the breadboard to LEDs. A resistor is also attached to the reset pin on the chip as an added safety measure.

This code was only done on the G2553 as it is the only board where the chip is extractable for use on a breadboard.
